/**
 * The Skill Rating Engine — SynapTest's fair, motivating skill measure.
 *
 * Pure, deterministic Elo over (question difficulty + correctness). No AI/LLM,
 * no DB, no React — kept dependency-free and isolated so it stays
 * unit-testable (see `rating.test.ts`), exactly like `diagnose.ts`.
 *
 * Why Elo and not a points total: a sum of marks/XP rewards sheer VOLUME (grind
 * easy questions to win) and accuracy% rewards TIMIDITY (answer two easy ones,
 * "100%"). Elo instead measures the hardest level you reliably beat:
 *
 *   - correct on a question above your rating   -> big gain
 *   - correct on one far below you              -> ~zero gain (volume farming dies)
 *   - wrong on a hard question                  -> tiny loss (expected, no shame)
 *   - wrong on an easy question                 -> meaningful loss
 *
 * Every question is an "opponent"; answering it is a match. The result is
 * deterministic and explainable ("Hard solved: +18"), in keeping with the
 * product's no-black-box positioning.
 *
 * See docs/rating-system-spec.md for the full design + decision log.
