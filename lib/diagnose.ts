/**
 * The Diagnosis Engine — the core differentiator of SynapTest.
 *
 * Pure, deterministic logic over (score + per-question time). No AI/LLM.
 * This module is intentionally dependency-free and isolated so it stays
 * unit-testable (see `diagnose.test.ts`).
 *
 * Classification order matters — the FIRST matching rule wins:
 *
 *   1. unattempted                       -> TIME_MANAGEMENT
 *   2. correct && slow                   -> TOO_SLOW
 *   3. correct                           -> SOLID
 *   --- from here the answer is WRONG ---
 *   4. Easy difficulty                   -> CARELESS   (slip on an easy one)
 *   5. Medium/Hard && rushed             -> GUESS      (barely engaged = a guess)
 *   6. otherwise (Medium/Hard, worked it)-> CONCEPT_GAP (a real gap)
