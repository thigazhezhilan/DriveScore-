/**
 * Seed question bank for SynapTest.
 *
 * 18 original NEET-style questions (6 per subject, mixed difficulty), written
 * from standard NCERT Class 11–12 concepts. None are copied from any
 * commercial book.
 *
 * `parTimeSec` is a deliberate per-question budget — the Diagnosis Engine
 * uses it to decide TOO_SLOW / CARELESS, so the values are tuned so that all
 * four diagnosis categories are reachable in a normal sitting.
 *
 * The chosen `MOCK_QUESTION_IDS` below pick a fixed 9-question mock (3 per
 * subject) covering Easy/Medium/Hard so a grader can trigger every category.
